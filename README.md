OH GLOB FIND ELVES PLAYING INSTRUMENT GIFS OR SOMETHING OR MAKE THEM UGHHHHH


shuffle the days
either pre-plan instruments to make(Smart) or overlay random images of stuff.

umm maybe some gifs of reindeer and shit walking around the page
when user "opens" a door something should happen. save it to local storage. 
maybe opening doors unleashes elves/reindeer/whatever?
when door is open, plays the sound occasionally?
kinda out of tune?
can close door too (no, no you cannot)
LOCALSTORE.YES.
when door is open, get link to GH/npm

can avg web page handle 24 gifs bouncing around and that big of an audiograph? we'll find out!

write 1 javascript function that takes a door id and wires the handler up.
no synth made yet, no handler yo. just a plain door.

deng that bundle.js gonna get huge.

mmhm

ok so also make a twitter feed that posts whenever a new door "opens"
